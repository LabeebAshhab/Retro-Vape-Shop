The application allows users to log in either as an admin or a customer, and both types of users have specific functionalities assigned to them. However, there is a strict age limit of 18+ or a maximum of 80 years old for all users planning to use the application. To access the application, users need to create an account either as an admin or as a customer. The dashboard, which contains user data about all customers and admins, is accessible only to the admin. An admin has the power to remove or add other admin accounts and remove existing customer accounts. On the other hand, customers can purchase their preferred products by manually finding them or searching for their preferred flavor using the search bar and completing the purchase with their preferred payment method. The application's user-friendly interface and strict age limit make it a reliable and secure platform for buying and selling vapes or E-cigarettes.
